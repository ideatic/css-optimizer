## css_cleaner

css_cleaner is a tool included with css_optmizer whose objective is remove unused CSS selectors.

The difference between this and other unused selectors removal tools is that css_cleaner analizes ALL project files (templates, source code, javascript, etc.), extracting all names found on them, and removing from the CSS the names not found. It's like using a bazooka to kill a fly, but it really works :D
